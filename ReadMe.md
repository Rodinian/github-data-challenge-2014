# Humans of GitHub (HoG)

This entry to the [Third Annual GitHub Data
Challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge)
offers a visual exploration of the question *who uses GitHub*.

In the past, GitHub's user-base has been analyzed by exploring various social
graphs inferred using the site's [API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). The
novelty of our approach is that it *puts a face to the name*. Our visualization
uses the GitHub [Users API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/) to infer
Eigenfaces for the "humans of GitHub" and explores whether there are any strong
patterns in the avatars of GitHub users.
